# Resume Generator / Portfolio

The primary goals of this one-page static site is to be both my portfolio and a printable resume. I am also using this site as an opportunity to experiment with Vite's plugin system, and to figure out effective patterns for building a static site generator with little to no JS hydration.

- [x] Create a Vite SSG plugin
- [ ] Iron out all the issues with SSG production builds
- [x] Create utilities and a component system for HTML templating
- [x] Build out content and printable styles for the resume portion of the site
- [ ] Build out screen styles and the additional portfolio sections

If you currently have a PDF of my resume, that PDF was generated by opening a dev instance of this project in Chrome and printing to PDF. To see this in action, run `npm run dev`, navigate to http://localhost:3000 (which is not yet styled properly for screen), and print the page.

## Portfolio Projects

As I have not had time to build out my actual portfolio yet, here is a selection of the projects that I intend to include on the site.

# [davidlherring.pages.dev](https://davidlherring.pages.dev) (Currently Inactive)

This one-page static site is both my portfolio and my resume (go ahead and print the page). I was going to use [Astro](https://astro.build) to generate it, because Astro seems cool, but I decided it would be even cooler to DIY a site generator with just Vite.

## Note for Potential Employers
This site, and the associated build tooling, is currently unfinished. I fully intended to get the site in a working state before sending out my resume, but my personal free time has been limited, so I've focused on the content of the resume and the print stylings. If you have a PDF of my resume, it was generated by printing this site from a dev server instance. I do intend to continue development, because I have grand ambitions for both the build system and the site itself, but I did not want my timeline for applying to jobs to be held up by this site's development for too long.
